# Wytty: A Community-Driven Social Networking App üåê


Wytty was an ambitious project ‚Äî a **community-based social networking app** that I spearheaded as part of a startup venture. While the startup itself didn't achieve commercial success due to a valuable learning curve in entrepreneurship, the underlying software is a testament to what can be built with passion and dedication. The core application functions perfectly, and looking back, I can always envision ways to enhance it further!

### Project Vision & Features ‚ú®

Wytty was designed to foster vibrant online communities. Its vision was to provide a platform where users could connect, share, and engage around shared interests.

**Key features developed include:**

* **User Profiles:** Personalized profiles for members to express themselves.

* **Community Feeds:** Dynamic feeds displaying posts, updates, and interactions within specific communities.

* **Real-time Chat:** Instant messaging capabilities for seamless communication.

* **Content Sharing:** Support for various media types, including text, images, and short videos.

* **Moderation Tools:** Basic tools for community administrators to manage content and members.

### Technology Stack üõ†Ô∏è

Wytty was built using a robust and modern tech stack, ensuring a responsive and scalable experience:

* **Frontend (Mobile App):** `React Native` for cross-platform iOS and Android development.

* **Backend & Database:** `Firebase` (including Firestore for NoSQL database, Authentication, and Cloud Functions for serverless logic).

* **Web Presence:** A complementary `website frontend` using `ReactJS` and `Firebase hosting`.

* **Server Code:** Custom server-side logic within Firebase `Cloud Functions`.

### The Startup Journey & Lessons Learned üìà

My experience with Wytty Platforms was invaluable. It taught me extensively about not just software development, but also the complexities of launching and scaling a startup. While the business aspect didn't succeed, the development journey was a significant achievement. We successfully **presented the app at the 2023 IEDC Summit in CET** and were incredibly proud to **win 1st prize in the Horuss Productathon organized by GDSC GECT**. This project solidified my abilities in fullstack development, problem-solving, and managing a complete software lifecycle.

### Prizes & Recognition üèÜ

* **1st Prize, Horuss Productathon:** We were incredibly proud to secure **1st prize** in the highly competitive Horuss Productathon, organized by GDSC GECT, validating our technical achievements and problem-solving approach.

* **IEDC Summit Presentation:** Wytty was successfully **presented at the prestigious 2023 IEDC Summit in CET**, where we showcased our innovative social application to a wider audience and gained valuable insights.

### Current Status üöß

Please note that Wytty is currently **not hosted live** (was once hosted in App store and Play store). The provided codebases for the mobile app, website frontend, and server logic are available within the repository for review.

### Requirements:

- NodeJS
- Firebase CLI
- Expo and EAS CLI

### Step by step guide to make project run

1. Create firebase project and enable auth, firestore, storage, cloud functions.
2. Run npm install for the app code.
3. Since code is old there will be breaking changes.
4. Fix the issues and run in expo go app.
5. Just use AI for the rest ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
