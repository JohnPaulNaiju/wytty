# Wytty: A Community-Driven Social Experience üåê

Wytty was an ambitious project ‚Äî a **community-based social networking app** that I spearheaded as part of a startup venture. While the startup itself didn't achieve commercial success due to a valuable learning curve in entrepreneurship, the underlying software is a testament to what can be built with passion and dedication. The core application functions perfectly, and looking back, I can always envision ways to enhance it further!

### Project Vision & Features ‚ú®

Wytty was designed to foster vibrant online communities. Its vision was to provide a platform where users could connect, share, and engage around shared interests.

**Key features developed include:**

* **User Profiles:** Personalized profiles for members to express themselves.

* **Community Feeds:** Dynamic feeds displaying posts, updates, and interactions within specific communities.

* **Real-time Chat:** Instant messaging capabilities for seamless communication.

* **Content Sharing:** Support for various media types, including text, images, and short videos.

* **Moderation Tools:** Basic tools for community administrators to manage content and members.

### Technology Stack üõ†Ô∏è

Wytty was built using a robust and modern tech stack, ensuring a responsive and scalable experience:

* **Frontend (Mobile App):** `React Native` for cross-platform iOS and Android development.

* **Backend & Database:** `Firebase` (including Firestore for NoSQL database, Authentication, and Cloud Functions for serverless logic).

* **Web Presence:** A complementary `website frontend` using `ReactJS` and `Firebase hosting`.

* **Server Code:** Custom server-side logic within Firebase `Cloud Functions`.

### The Startup Journey & Lessons Learned üìà

My experience with Wytty Platforms was invaluable. It taught me extensively about not just software development, but also the complexities of launching and scaling a startup. While the business aspect didn't succeed, the development journey was a significant achievement. We successfully **presented the app at the 2023 IEDC Summit in CET** and were incredibly proud to **win 1st prize in the Horuss Productathon organized by GDSC GECT**. This project solidified my abilities in fullstack development, problem-solving, and managing a complete software lifecycle.

### Current Status üöß

Please note that Wytty is currently **not hosted live** (wwas once hosted in App store and Play store). The provided codebases for the mobile app, website frontend, and server logic are available within the repository for review.
